# Digit-Recognizer

This project is about classifying numbers based on the images given as input.

Used TensorFlow sequential model consisting of layers Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Dropout, BatchNormalization, Dense.

Performed data argumentation using tensorflow's ImageDataGenerator and implemented learning rate decay.

Accuracy on train data: 100%

Accuracy on test data: 0.99671%
